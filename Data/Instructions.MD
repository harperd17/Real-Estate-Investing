Data has been uploaded to my google drive and can be gathered using this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1okeyFvt9hh6fuYwOOWqatxSF8YXQ4zWA?usp=sharing). However, if you would like to follow along, or get data in the future as these sources get updated, following the instructions below.<br>
The Zillow data sets come from [here](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). Go under the 'Home values' section and in the drop down select 'ZHVI 1-Bedroom Time Series' and do the same for 2, 3, and 4 bedroom and also get 'ZHVI Condo/Co-op Time Series' under the 'Data Type' drop down. Then, for each of the 5 selections, select 'County' under the 'Geography' drop down.<br>
Then, go [here](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-housing-units.html) to get the U.S. Census Bureau Housing Unit data set. Scroll down until you see 'Annual Estimates of County Housing Units for States: 2010 to 2019' and then under this header click on 'United States' and the file will download.<br>
Lastly, go to [here](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html) to grab the U.S. Census Bureau demographics and population data set. Scroll down until you see the header 'Annual County Resident Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 (CC-EST2019-ALLDATA). Under this header click on 'United States' and the data file will download.<br>
To get the file used for longitude and latitude of each county, go [here](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html) and scroll down until you see the 'County' header then click the link under that header and the file will downloade.<br>
Lastly, there was Zillow renter data liste under the project proposal, but after further inspection, I found out that this data file didn't have data for enough counties, so I ended up doing this project without that data file.<br>
If you save the downloaded files (a total of 8) under a 'Data' folder in the same directory as this notebook, then this notebook should work for you. The spatial file should be saved in a folder named 'Census_Bureau'.
All metadata for the data can be found on the respective data links as well.
